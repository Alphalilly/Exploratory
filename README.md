# Exploratory:
- Learning 2D Animation in a 3D Workflow


Ill be learning the 12 principles of animation, along side blender and its 3D tools. mainly the Grease Pencil tool, it will be bridging the gap between 3D blockouts and my 2D drawings.

A simple example of what I hope to achieve: [Eaki üå∏üê¢ on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Eaki_Turtle/status/1554605520253726720)
 *to clarify, I'm referring to the style, not the composition.*

Ill be working on a project along side my learning, using what i make in the assignments to put it all together in the end. I'll be showing off my progress during the midterm presentation and hopefully the final thing at the final presentation.

This is the music I had in mind for the animation. I'll use it as a starting point: [C418 - Dreiton (Minecraft) (Nihhiu Remix) old 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_8xb0xFSM0)

my goal is to at least get started building up my technical skills in 2D animation. As well as explore my creativity a little bit with a project. Seeing how well i can tell a story simply with symbols, movement and expression. or "Visual storytelling"! 

This is all a little different then what I usually do. As an aspiring 3D character artist it doesn't really make sense all that much, but I'm more or less thinking about it as improving my art skills as a whole. (and its something I've wanted to try for a long time)

yes
